To reproduce the graphs found in the report just go to the relevant .ipynb notebook and run it, we made it so that each notebook can be run independently.

Some graphs in exercise 1 require lots of hours to be re-produced so perhaps some parameters might need to be asjusted by the tutor, e.g. the fixed time step and Monte Carlo samples.
